# Angular-cities-app
This is an application written with AngularJS, and uses two controllers and two template files. 

Initial dislay shows a list of US cities, organized by rank based on population. This can be filtered using Angular's filter feature. 

Clicking on the name of each city will display an additional view showing population, latitude and longitude, as well as a google street maps image fetched from the API based on the city's latitude and longitude.
