# Angular-cities-app
This is an application written with AngularJS, and uses two controllers and two template files. 

Initial dislay shows a list of US cities, organized by rank based on population. 

Clicking on the name of each city will display an additional view showing population, latitude and longitude, as well as a google street maps image fetched from the API based on the city's latitude and longitude.
